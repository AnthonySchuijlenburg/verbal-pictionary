# Verbal Pictionary

A web application for playing Verbal Picionary with friends. The game is a mix of Pictionary and charades, where players take turns describing a word or phrase without saying (part of) it and the other players have to guess what it is.

This project has been made because of the lack of a good online version of the game. The goal is to make a simple, easy to use, and most importantly free (of ads) web application for playing Verbal Pictionary with friends.

The project is built with [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/), a Vue.js framework, and uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling. A live version of this project can be found on [verbal-pictionary.pages.dev](https://verbal-pictionary.pages.dev/).
